This theme is developed for my personal use, but I have tried to keep things general enough for it to be used by anyone.

There are a couple of theme options worth noting.
* each of the 'tabs' across the top is a link by default the links can be turned off in the options
* there is an option to enter the author's user id in order to determine whose comments get highlighted
* there are some text fields to allow for certain resources to be hosted elsewhere

The last is a little bit of an oddity I'll admit, the reason I did it however is so I would be able to use a combine script in order to reduce the number of requests being made.
